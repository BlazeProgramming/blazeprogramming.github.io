      <p>It's been a while.</p>
      <p>So my most recent (and most difficult and trying) project is my Tucker discord bot. It's a multipurpose bot mostly built for the Khan Academy Discord Server by me and <a href="https://www.kingcodefish.com/">KingCodeFish</a>.</p>
      <p>Some of the main features are: KA API thingies, such as program and user data, a rank system, a talkshow system, and tons of other fun commands.</p>
      <p>You can see it in use on the official discord server.</p>

       <strong>Terragen 3 "Q-Cascade" Rendering</strong>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
      <em><small>July 29, 2016</small></em>
      <p>So I <em>love</em> Terragen. (You can download it for free, and plus, it's awesome!!!!!) No seriously, download it.</p>
      <p>Recently I decided to get serious about rendering using it. So I started one of my best renders (which took over 2 days to render!). It's a nice render, but that's not what I'm going to talk about today.</p>
      <p>I started another render today, called the "Q-Cascade". I just call it that. I don't know where it came from.</p>
      <hr width="200">
      <p>I started with a blank template and added a fractal terrain. Then I added the grass and snow shaders to the file and produced a small render.</p>
      <img src="images/q0.tif">
      <p>But I was a bit confused how to make the render better than my basic "mountains, sky, and water" render. So I looked up basic population using Terragen (which is disturbingly simple). Then I created my secondary render adding a pine tree population around the base of the mountain.</p>
      <img src="images/q1.tif">
      <p>But honestly, to me it looked terrible. I think that I would have been bothered by the obvious line where the trees ended. So I extended the tree line. Of course, then, there were 900,000 tree instances.... so it lagged. But here's what it looked like. (I may have extended the treeline too far...)</p>
      <img src="images/q2.tif">
      <p>First things first though, to render these "little pictures", it's already taking an extreme amount of time. Normal "quick" renders take about 20-30 seconds, but these (due to the now millions of trees being rendered) are taking nearly 2 minutes.</p>
      <p>My longest render (which coincidentally killed my old computer) took over 54 hours. I'm already thinking that this piece will rival that, but I don't want to kill my new computer either. So I made a flash decision not to include atmosphere in the piece (maybe later?) and repopulated the frame. This render included over 1.5 million trees only in the actual camera view. Now I understand how there's over a billion (trillion?) trees on Earth.</p>
      <img src="images/q3.tif">
      <p>The render above took over 2 minutes and ate 5% of my computer battery. Daaaarn.</p>
      <p>After being finished populating the trees, I messed with the light angle and some atmosphere stuff and produced this render.</p>
      <p>(Note that including the sun in a picture usually increases render time by about ~10% based on many of my previous renders. But thankfully, the more you use Terragen, the more the render time decreases, so my render time was back under 2 minutes.... barely.</p>
      <img src="images/q4.tif">
      <p>Then I messed with the initial rock shader to give more of a fertile, rocky look to the mountains. Just trying to make it as pretty as possible! xD</p>
      <img src="images/q5.tif">
      <p>There's only a slight difference between q4 and q5, but the later I get in a project, the more I render to make sure I'm doing everything right. Thankfully, I did this right.</p>
      <p>I messed around with water, but I didn't like the extreme low-quality render. But ALWAYS, ALWAYS still low-quality render to make sure that you don't like something before you delete it! But I still hated it and felt that it detracted from the piece. It also created a few confusing shadows... and trees <em>in</em> the water?!?!</p>
      <p>Also, this render took 3 minutes instead of 2. Definitely deleted that water. (By the way, if anyone would like the water render if you think it's pretty for some reason? you can contact me at my email address, blazeprograms@gmail.com)</p>
      <img src="images/q6.tif">
      <p>So I exchanged one evil for another; water for atmosphere. Atmosphere is AMAZING! It looked great on this picture. So here's my low qual render on that one.</p>
      <p>I also turned on "Cast Shadows Into Atmosphere" as I prepare for the final render. You can read a little thing on that at the bottom of <a href="http://people.cornellcollege.edu/dsherman/terragen3-tutorial.html">this page</a>, which is also, coincidentally, where I learned how to populate objects a while ago (30 minutes ago).</p>
      <p>This minimal render took well over 5 minutes to render.</p>
      <img src="images/q7.tif">
      <p>I liked the sun ray effect, so I kept that. But the scene is now very dark and I can't see all the work I put into the trees. I <em>guess</em> that's okay? In real life, trees aren't always pronounced and/or seen.</p>
      <p>I just want a good composition.</p>
      <p>So I moved the entire scene over.</p>
      <img src="images/q8.tif">
      <p>But now, the real problem arises; which composition do I like better? Should I keep one, should I add both?</p>
      <p>Nope, I like this one better. Immediately, I saved the project so that if my computer died, I'd still have that info.</p>
      <p>Of course, I made a dumb mistake. I forgot to use a different render camera! xD</p>
      <p>So <em>NOW</em> I'm rendering the second angle, which I saved as "angle2_lowrender".</p>
      <img src="images/q9.tif">
      <p>I didn't know what else to do, so I moved the sun. Bad idea.</p>
      <img src="images/q10.tif">
      <p>Now on to the final render...</p>
      <p>I'm going to render both angles (angle_1 and angle_2) and put them as high quality as I can (1280x720). Eventually, when I'm rich, I'll do an ultimate render with the full version of Terragen. But there'll probably be Terragen 4 by then. Maybe it'll be cheaper for the full version :P</p>
      <p>When I finish the final renders, I'll place them here, but for now, you're stuck with the low qual stuff. Woo.... hoo...</p>
